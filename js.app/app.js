Legal Variable Names:

1.Variable names must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_) character.

Legal: myVar, _privateVar
Illegal: 123Var, @specialVar
2.After the first character, variable names can contain letters, digits (0-9), underscores (_), and dollar signs ($).

Legal: myVar2, _var_name, $price
Illegal: my-var, my var, my%var

3.Variable names are case-sensitive, so myVar and myvar are treated as different variables.

Legal: myVar, myvar
Illegal: None


In JavaScript, the name of the arithmetic operator that gives you the remainder when one number is divided by another is called the "modulo" operator. The symbol for the modulo operator is %.


In JavaScript, when you use the modulo operator %, it calculates the remainder when one number is divided by another. In the code var num = 20 % 6;, num will be assigned the value 2.

This is because when you divide 20 by 6, you get a quotient of 3 with a remainder of 2, and the modulo operator % returns the remainder, which is 2 in this case.
